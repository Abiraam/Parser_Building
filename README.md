# Parser_Building

Introduction:

For this project, we are required to program a parser using the scanner from the previous project. The program was made with Java and it consists of 3 files, Parser.java which is used to run the entire program, Automata Scanner.java which scans through the file, and Input.java which is used to hold all of the tokens and data from those tokens to be printed.

Data Structures:

Members of the AutomataScanner class:
    ● tokens: an ArrayList of Strings. Is used as the stack that contains all the tokens from the
      scanner.
    ● tokenText: an ArrayList of Strings. Is used as the stack that contains the corresponding
      text that created a token. For example, if index i in the tokens ArrayList is an id, then tokenText at index i contains the name of the variable.
